# Scoping rules

The main difference is scoping rules. Variables declared by  `var`  keyword are scoped to the immediate function body (hence the function scope) while  `let`  variables are scoped to the immediate  _enclosing_  block denoted by  `{ }`  (hence the block scope).

```javascript
function run() {
  var foo = "Foo";
  let bar = "Bar";

  console.log(foo, bar); // Foo Bar

  {
    var moo = "Mooo"
    let baz = "Bazz";
    console.log(moo, baz); // Mooo Bazz
  }

  console.log(moo); // Mooo
  console.log(baz); // ReferenceError
}

run();
```

The reason why  `let`  keyword was introduced to the language was function scope is confusing and was one of the main sources of bugs in JavaScript.

Take a look at this example from  [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/750486/javascript-closure-inside-loops-simple-practical-example):

```javascript
var funcs = [];
// let's create 3 functions
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  // and store them in funcs
  funcs[i] = function() {
    // each should log its value.
    console.log("My value: " + i);
  };
}
for (var j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
  // and now let's run each one to see
  funcs[j]();
}
```
`My value: 3`  was output to console each time  `funcs[j]();`  was invoked since anonymous functions were bound to the same variable.

People had to create immediately invoked functions to capture correct values from the loops but that was also hairy.


# Hoisting

While variables declared with  `var`  keyword are  [hoisted](https://dev.to/godcrampy/the-secret-of-hoisting-in-javascript-egi)  (initialized with  `undefined`  before the code is run) which means they are accessible in their enclosing scope even before they are declared:

```javascript
function run() {
  console.log(foo); // undefined
  var foo = "Foo";
  console.log(foo); // Foo
}

run();
```
`  
let`  variables are not initialized until their definition is evaluated. Accessing them before the initialization results in a  `ReferenceError`. Variable said to be in "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the initialization is processed.

```javascript
function checkHoisting() {
  console.log(foo); // ReferenceError
  let foo = "Foo";
  console.log(foo); // Foo
}

checkHoisting();
```

# Creating global object property

At the top level,  `let`, unlike  `var`, does not create a property on the global object:

```javascript
var foo = "Foo";  // globally scoped
let bar = "Bar"; // not allowed to be globally scoped

console.log(window.foo); // Foo
console.log(window.bar); // undefined
```
# Redeclaration

In strict mode,  `var`  will let you re-declare the same variable in the same scope while  `let`  raises a SyntaxError.

```javascript
'use strict';
var foo = "foo1";
var foo = "foo2"; // No problem, 'foo1' is replaced with 'foo2'.

let bar = "bar1"; 
let bar = "bar2"; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'bar' has already been declared
```
